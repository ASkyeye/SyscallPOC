This POC was inspired by Jack Halon and his [Utilizing Syscalls in C#](https://jhalon.github.io/utilizing-syscalls-in-csharp-1/) [series](https://jhalon.github.io/utilizing-syscalls-in-csharp-2/) as well as
badBounty's [directinjectorPOC](https://github.com/badBounty/directInjectorPOC). Thanks to both!
